Readings: [Christensen Chapter 2 and Chapter 6, Appendix A & B as needed C](http://getitatduke.library.duke.edu/?sid=sersol&SS_jc=TC0000508493&title=Plane%20Answers%20to%20Complex%20Questions%3A%20The%20Theory%20of%20Linear%20Models)

In this lecture we will introduce the Bayesian perspective for estimation in linear models.  We will start with the Conjugate Normal-Gamma prior and show that the posterior is in the same family.  This induces marginal distributions that are (multivariate) Student-t for any  linear combination of the parameters $\beta$.
