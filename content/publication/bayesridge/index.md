In this lecture we look at ridge regression can be formulated  as a Bayesian estimator and discuss prior distributions on the ridge parameter.  As estimators with smaller MSE can be obtained by allowing a different shrinkage parameter for each coordinate we relax the assumption of a common ridge parameter and consider generalized ridge estimators and implications for prior choice.
