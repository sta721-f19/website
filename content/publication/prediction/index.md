Readings: [Christensen Chapter 2, Appendex C](http://getitatduke.library.duke.edu/?sid=sersol&SS_jc=TC0000508493&title=Plane%20Answers%20to%20Complex%20Questions%3A%20The%20Theory%20of%20Linear%20Models)

In this lecture we derive predictive distributions and will talk about optimal prediction and estimation using squared error loss or quadratic loss. We will extend estimation to the case where $X$ is not full rank and talk about what quantities can still be estimated uniquely from the data, a concept related to identifiability.
