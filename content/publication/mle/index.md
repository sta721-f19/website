In this lecture we will show how to use  projection matrices to find the maximum likelihood estimates of $\beta$ in a Gaussian linear model, avoiding the use of derivatives, but instead taking a geometric approach.

Readings: [Christensen Chapter 1-2, Appendex A & B](http://getitatduke.library.duke.edu/?sid=sersol&SS_jc=TC0000508493&title=Plane%20Answers%20to%20Complex%20Questions%3A%20The%20Theory%20of%20Linear%20Models)

Matrix Algebra Review from [StatSci Boot Camp](https://github.com/DukeStatSci/MathBootcamp2018/blob/master/Handouts/02_Matrices.pdf)

Please review the material in Chapter 1 of Christensen on expectations of vectors and matrices before class.
