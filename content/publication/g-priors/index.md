Readings: [Christensen Chapter 2 and Chapter 6, Appendix A & B as needed C](http://getitatduke.library.duke.edu/?sid=sersol&SS_jc=TC0000508493&title=Plane%20Answers%20to%20Complex%20Questions%3A%20The%20Theory%20of%20Linear%20Models)

In this lecture we will continue with the Bayesian perspective for estimation in linear models, and discuss various recommendations of Conjugate Normal-Gamma priors and the resulting posterior distributions, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of conjugate priors. We will discuss a special case of a conjugate prior, namely Zellner's g-prior. Finally we will discuss the role of invariance  in construction of default prior distributions and the resulting inference and prediction problems.
