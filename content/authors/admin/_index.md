This course introduces students to Gaussian linear models and extensions for model building, including exploratory data analysis techniques and model checking, variable transformations and selection, parameter estimation and interpretation, prediction, hierarchical models, model selection and Bayesian model averaging. The concepts of linear models will be covered from Bayesian and classical viewpoints. Topics in Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation will be introduced as required. Co-requisite STA 601.

### Computation 
  We will use R as a programming language
   for computation and data analysis, with the use existing packages written
  in R to support the course. All students will have access to [RStudio/R](#resources) on a server within the department and support during the labs. You are free to all run RStudio/R on your personal laptop or desktop.
  See the [Resources](#resources) page
  for books and other resources for learning R. You should bring a calculator to exams. There is no  restrictions on the type of calculator (but not on a mobile device).

### Discussion Forums

We will be using
[Piazza](https://piazza.com/duke/fall2019/sta72101f19/home) for class
discussion. The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and
efficiently from classmates, the TAs, and myself. Rather than emailing
questions to the teaching staff, I encourage you to post your
questions on Piazza (peer answers earn participation points!). If you
have any problems or feedback for the developers, email
team@piazza.com.

Find our class page at:
[Piazza](https://piazza.com/duke/fall2019/sta72101f19/home)  or

### Green Classroom

<img style="float: left;" src="/img/DukeGreenClassroomCertification-Logo.png">
This course has achieved Dukeâ€™s Green Classroom Certification. The certification indicates that the faculty member teaching this course has taken significant steps to green the delivery of this course. Your faculty member has completed a checklist indicating their common practices in areas of this course that have an environmental impact, such as paper and energy consumption. Some common practices implemented by faculty to reduce the environmental impact of their course include allowing electronic submission of assignments, providing online readings and turning off lights and electronics in the classroom when they are not in use. The eco-friendly aspects of course delivery may vary by faculty, by course and throughout the semester.
